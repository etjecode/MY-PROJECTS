<h1>Introduction</h1>
<h2>JavaScript Can Change HTML Content</h2>
<code>
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello JavaScript";
</code>

<p><strong>Note: </strong>JavaScript accepts both double and single quotes.</p>

<h2>JavaScript Can Change HTML Attribute Values</h2>
<code>
    document.getElementById('myImage').src = 'pic_bulbon.gif';
</code>

<h2>JavaScript Can Change HTML Styles (CSS)</h2>

<code>
    document.getElementById("demo").style.fontSize = "35px";
</code>

<h2>JavaScript Can Hide HTML Elements</h2>
<code>
    document.getElementById("demo").style.display = "none";
</code>

<h2>JavaScript Can Show HTML Elements</h2>
<code>
    document.getElementById("demo").style.display = "block";
</code>
</div>

<div>
<h1>Where To</h1>
<p>In HTML, JavaScript code is inserted between script tags.
    <ul>
<li>You can place any number of scripts in an HTML document.</li>
<li>Scripts can be placed in the body, or in the head section of an HTML page, or in both.</li>
<li>Placing scripts at the bottom of the body element improves the display speed, because script interpretation slows down the display.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Scripts can also be placed in external files.
<ul>
<li>External scripts are practical when the same code is used in many different web pages.</li>
<li>To use an external script, put the name of the script file in the src (source) attribute of a script tag.</li>
<li>You can place an external script reference in head or body as you like.</li>
<li>>The script will behave as if it was located exactly where the script tag is located.</li>
</ul>
</p>
</div>

<div>
<h1>JavaScript Output</h1>

<p>JavaScript can "display" data in different ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Writing into an HTML element, using innerHTML.</li>
<br>
<code>
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = 5 + 6;
</code>
<br><br>
<li>Writing into the HTML output using document.write().</li>
<br>
<code>
    document.write(5 + 6)
</code>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>Using document.write() after an HTML document is loaded, will delete all existing HTML.
<br><br>This method should only be used for testing.</p>
<li>Writing into an alert box, using window.alert().</li>
<p>You can skip the window keyword. In JavaScript, the window object is the global scope object, that means that variables, properties, and methods by default belong to the window object. This also means that specifying the window keyword is optional.</p>
<li>Writing into the browser console, using console.log().</li>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>JavaScript does not have any print object or print methods. You cannot access output devices from JavaScript. The only exception is that you can call the window.print() method in the browser to print the content of the current window.</p>
</ul>
</div>

<div>
<h1>JavaScript Statements</h1>

<p>JavaScript statements are composed of:
<br><br>Values, Operators, Expressions, Keywords, and Comments.
<br><br>The statements are executed, one by one, in the same order as they are written.</p>

<p><strong>Notes: </strong>Ending statements with semicolon is not required, but highly recommended.
<br><br>You can add white space to your script to make it more readable. A good practice is to put spaces around operators ( = + - * / ).
<br><br>For best readability, programmers often like to avoid code lines longer than 80 characters. If a JavaScript statement does not fit on one line, the best place to break it is after an operator.
</p>
</div>

<div>
<h1>JavaScript Comments</h1>
<code>
    // x = 6;
    <br><br>
    /* x = 6; */
</code>
</div>

<div>
<h1>JavaScript and Camel Case</h1>

<h2>Hyphens</h2>

<code>first-name, last-name, master-card, inter-city</code>

<p><strong>Note: </strong>Hyphens are not allowed in JavaScript. They are reserved for subtractions.</p>

<h2>Underscore</h2>

<code>first_name, last_name, master_card, inter_city</code>

<h2>Upper Camel Case (Pascal Case)</h2>

<code>FirstName, LastName, MasterCard, InterCity</code>

<h2>Lower Camel Case</h2>

<code>firstName, lastName, masterCard, interCity</code>

<p><strong>Note: </strong>JavaScript programmers tend to use camel case that starts with a lowercase letter.</p>
</div>

<div>
    <h1>JavaScript Variables</h1>
    <p>Variables are containers for storing data values.</p>
        <h2>4 Ways to Declare a JavaScript Variable</h2>
        <h3>var</h3>
    <p><ul>
        <li>The var keyword is used in all JavaScript code from 1995 to 2015.</li>
        <li>Variables defined with var can be Redeclared.</li>
        <li>You can use the variable before it is declared.</li>
        <li>Redeclaring a variable using the var keyword can impose problems.</li>
        <li>Redeclaring a variable inside a block will also redeclare the variable outside the block.</li>
        <li>Variables declared with the var keyword can NOT have block scope.</li>
        <li>Variables declared inside a { } block can be accessed from outside the block.</li>

    </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>let</h3>
    <p><ul>
        <li>The let keyword was introduced in ES6 (2015).</li>
        <li>Variables defined with let cannot be Redeclared.</li>
        <li>Variables defined with let must be Declared before use.</li>
        <li>Variables defined with let have Block Scope.</li>
        <li>Variables declared inside a { } block cannot be accessed from outside the block.</li>
        <li>Redeclaring a variable with let, in another block, IS allowed.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>const</h3>
    <p><ul>
        <li>The const keyword was introduced in ES6 (2015).</li>
        <li>Variables defined with const cannot be Redeclared.</li>
        <li>Variables defined with const have Block Scope.</li>
        <li>Variables declared inside a { } block cannot be accessed from outside the block.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

        <p><strong>Note: </strong>It's a good programming practice to declare all variables at the beginning of a script.</p>
        <h2>JavaScript Identifiers</h2>
        <p>The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are:
                
<ul><li>Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.</li>
    <li>Names must begin with a letter (A-Z or a-z).</li>
    <li>Names can also begin with a dollar sign ($) or an underscore (_).</li>
    <li>Names are case sensitive.</li>
    <li>Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Notes: </strong><ul><li>Numbers are not allowed as the first character in names.</li>
<li>JavaScript treats $ and _ as letters.</li>
<li>Using the dollar sign is not very common in JavaScript, but professional programmers often use it as an alias for the main function in a JavaScript library.</li>
<li>Using the underscore is not very common in JavaScript, but a convention among professional programmers is to use it as an alias for "private (hidden)" variables.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>undefined</h2>
<p>A variable declared without a value will have the value undefined.</p>
<h2>Re-declaring JavaScript Variables</h2>
<p>If you re-declare a JavaScript variable declared with var, it will not lose its value.</p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>You cannot re-declare a variable declared with let or const.</p>
<h2>JavaScript Arithmetic</h2>
<p>If you put a number in quotes, the rest of the numbers will be treated as strings, and concatenated.</p>
