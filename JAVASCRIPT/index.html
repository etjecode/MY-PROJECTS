        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <h2>JavaScript Can Change HTML Content</h2>
        <code>
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello JavaScript";
</code>

        <p><strong>Note: </strong>JavaScript accepts both double and single quotes.</p>

        <h2>JavaScript Can Change HTML Attribute Values</h2>
        <code>
    document.getElementById('myImage').src = 'pic_bulbon.gif';
</code>

        <h2>JavaScript Can Change HTML Styles (CSS)</h2>

        <code>
    document.getElementById("demo").style.fontSize = "35px";
</code>

        <h2>JavaScript Can Hide HTML Elements</h2>
        <code>
    document.getElementById("demo").style.display = "none";
</code>

        <h2>JavaScript Can Show HTML Elements</h2>
        <code>
    document.getElementById("demo").style.display = "block";
</code>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h1>Where To</h1>
        <p>In HTML, JavaScript code is inserted between script tags.
        <ul>
            <li>You can place any number of scripts in an HTML document.</li>
            <li>Scripts can be placed in the body, or in the head section of an HTML page, or in both.</li>
            <li>Placing scripts at the bottom of the body element improves the display speed, because script
                interpretation slows down the display.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <p>Scripts can also be placed in external files.
        <ul>
            <li>External scripts are practical when the same code is used in many different web pages.</li>
            <li>To use an external script, put the name of the script file in the src (source) attribute of a script
                tag.</li>
            <li>You can place an external script reference in head or body as you like.</li>
            <li>>The script will behave as if it was located exactly where the script tag is located.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h1>JavaScript Output</h1>

        <p>JavaScript can "display" data in different ways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Writing into an HTML element, using innerHTML.</li>
            <br>
            <code>
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = 5 + 6;
</code>
            <br><br>
            <li>Writing into the HTML output using document.write().</li>
            <br>
            <code>
    document.write(5 + 6)
</code>
            <p><strong>Note: </strong>Using document.write() after an HTML document is loaded, will delete all existing
                HTML.
                <br><br>This method should only be used for testing.
            </p>
            <li>Writing into an alert box, using window.alert().</li>
            <p>You can skip the window keyword. In JavaScript, the window object is the global scope object, that means
                that variables, properties, and methods by default belong to the window object. This also means that
                specifying the window keyword is optional.</p>
            <li>Writing into the browser console, using console.log().</li>
            <p><strong>Note: </strong>JavaScript does not have any print object or print methods. You cannot access
                output devices from JavaScript. The only exception is that you can call the window.print() method in the
                browser to print the content of the current window.</p>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h1>JavaScript Statements</h1>

        <p>JavaScript statements are composed of:
            <br><br>Values, Operators, Expressions, Keywords, and Comments.
            <br><br>The statements are executed, one by one, in the same order as they are written.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Notes: </strong>Ending statements with semicolon is not required, but highly recommended.
            <br><br>You can add white space to your script to make it more readable. A good practice is to put spaces
            around operators ( = + - * / ).
            <br><br>For best readability, programmers often like to avoid code lines longer than 80 characters. If a
            JavaScript statement does not fit on one line, the best place to break it is after an operator.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h1>JavaScript Comments</h1>
        <code>
    // x = 6;
    <br><br>
    /* x = 6; */
</code>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h1>JavaScript and Camel Case</h1>

        <h2>Hyphens</h2>

        <code>first-name, last-name, master-card, inter-city</code>

        <p><strong>Note: </strong>Hyphens are not allowed in JavaScript. They are reserved for subtractions.</p>

        <h2>Underscore</h2>

        <code>first_name, last_name, master_card, inter_city</code>

        <h2>Upper Camel Case (Pascal Case)</h2>

        <code>FirstName, LastName, MasterCard, InterCity</code>

        <h2>Lower Camel Case</h2>

        <code>firstName, lastName, masterCard, interCity</code>

        <p><strong>Note: </strong>JavaScript programmers tend to use camel case that starts with a lowercase letter.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h1>JavaScript Variables</h1>
        <p>Variables are containers for storing data values.</p>
        <h2>4 Ways to Declare a JavaScript Variable</h2>

        <h3>var</h3>
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li>The var keyword is used in all JavaScript code from 1995 to 2015.</li>
            <li>Variables defined with var can be Redeclared.</li>
            <li>If you re-declare a JavaScript variable declared with var, it will not lose its value.</li>
            <li>Variables declared with the var keyword can NOT have block scope.</li>
            <li>You can use the variable defined with var before it is declared.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h4>When to use JavaScript var</h4>
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li>The var keyword is used in all JavaScript code from 1995 to 2015.</li>
            <li>The let and const keywords were added to JavaScript in 2015.</li>
            <li>If you want your code to run in older browser, you must use var.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>let</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>The let keyword was introduced in ES6 (2015).</li>
                <li>Variables defined with let cannot be Redeclared.</li>
                <li>You cannot accidentally redeclare a variable.</li>
                <li>Variables defined with let have Block Scope.</li>
                <li>Variables defined with let must be Declared before use.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h4>When to use JavaScript let</h4>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>If you want a general rule: always declare variables with const.</li>
                <li>If you think the value of the variable can change, use let.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>        

        <h3>const</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>The const keyword was introduced in ES6 (2015).</li>
                <li>Variables defined with const cannot be Redeclared.</li>
                <li>Variables defined with const cannot be Reassigned.</li>
                <li>JavaScript const variables must be assigned a value when they are declared.</li>
                <li>Variables defined with const have Block Scope.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h4>When to use JavaScript const</h4>
        <p>As a general rule, always declare a variable with const unless you know that the value will change.

        <p>
        <ul>Use const when you declare:
            <li>A new Array</li>
            <li>A new Object</li>
            <li>A new Function</li>
            <li>A new RegExp</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <p><strong>Note: </strong>It's a good programming practice to declare all variables at the beginning of a
            script.</p>

        <h2>Block Scope</h2>
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Before ES6 (2015), JavaScript had only <strong>Global Scope</strong> and <strong>Function Scope</strong>.</li>
            <li>ES6 introduced two important new JavaScript keywords: let and const.</li>
            <li>These two keywords provide <strong>Block Scope</strong> in JavaScript.</li>
            <li>Variables declared inside a { } block cannot be accessed from outside the block.</li>
            <li>Variables declared with the var keyword can NOT have block scope.</li>
            <li>Variables declared inside a { } block can be accessed from outside the block.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>undefined</h2>
        <p>A variable declared without a value will have the value <strong>undefined</strong></p>

        <h2>Re-declaring JavaScript Variables</h2>
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Variables defined with var can be Redeclared.</li>
            <li>If you re-declare a JavaScript variable declared with var, it will not lose its value.</li>
            <li>You cannot re-declare a variable declared with let or const.</li>
            <li>However, redeclaring a variable using the var keyword can impose problems.</li>
            <li>Redeclaring a variable inside a block will also redeclare the variable outside the block.</li>
            <li>Redeclaring a variable using the let keyword can solve this problem.</li>
            <li>Redeclaring a variable inside a block will not redeclare the variable outside the block.</li>
            <li>Redeclaring a JavaScript variable with var is allowed anywhere in a program.</li>
            <li>With let, redeclaring a variable in the same block is NOT allowed.</li>
            <li>However, redeclaring a variable with let, in another block, IS allowed.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Hoisting</h2>
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Variables defined with var are hoisted to the top and can be initialized at any time.</li>
            <li>Meaning: You can use the variable before it is declared.</li>
            <li>Variables defined with let and const are also hoisted to the top of the block, but not initialized.</li>
            <li>Meaning: Using a let or const variable before it is declared will result in a ReferenceError.</li>
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>JavaScript Identifiers</h2>
        <p>The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are:
        <ul>
            <li>Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.</li>
            <li>Names must begin with a letter (A-Z or a-z).</li>
            <li>Names can also begin with a dollar sign ($) or an underscore (_).</li>
            <li>Names are case sensitive.</li>
            <li>Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Notes: </strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Numbers are not allowed as the first character in names.</li>
            <li>JavaScript treats $ and _ as letters.</li>
            <li>Using the dollar sign is not very common in JavaScript, but professional programmers often use it as an
                alias for the main function in a JavaScript library.</li>
            <li>Using the underscore is not very common in JavaScript, but a convention among professional programmers
                is to use it as an alias for "private (hidden)" variables.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>JavaScript Arithmetic</h2>
        <p>If you put a number in quotes, the rest of the numbers will be treated as strings, and concatenated.</p>


        <h2>Constant Objects and Arrays</h2>

<p>The keyword const is a little misleading. It does not define a constant value. It defines a constant reference to a value. Because of this you can NOT:
    <ul>
<li>Reassign a constant value</li>
<li>Reassign a constant array</li>
<li>Reassign a constant object</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>But you CAN:
    <ul>
        <li>Change the elements of constant array</li>
        <li>Change the properties of constant object</li>
    </ul></p>

    <h3>Constant Arrays</h3>
    <p>You can change the elements of a constant array but you can NOT reassign the array.</p>

    <h3>Constant Objects</h3>
    <p>You can change the properties of a constant object but you can NOT reassign the object.</p>

    </div>

    <div>
        <h1>JavaScript Type Operators</h1>
        <ul><li><strong>typeof</strong> returns the type of a variable.</li>
            <li><strong>instanceof</strong> returns true if an object is an instance of an object type.</li></ul>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h1>Data Types</h1>
        <h2>Booleans</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>A JavaScript Boolean represents one of two values: true or false.</li>
                <li>The Boolean value of an expression is the basis for all JavaScript comparisons and conditions.</li>
                <li>Everything With a "Value" is True</li>
                <li>Everything Without a "Value" is False</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>JavaScript Booleans as Objects</h3>
<p>Normally JavaScript booleans are primitive values created from literals.

But booleans can also be defined as objects with the keyword new.


Do not create Boolean objects.

The new keyword complicates the code and slows down execution speed.

Boolean objects can produce unexpected results.
Booleans and Boolean objects cannot be safely compared.


Comparing two JavaScript objects always return false.
